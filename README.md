### Chat++ Rework Plugin for SAMP

**Description:**
This repository hosts a reworked version of the Chat++ plugin originally developed for San Andreas Multiplayer (SAMP). The plugin enhances the in-game chat functionality with improved text copying, color options, and better compatibility.

**Improvements:**
- **Enhanced Text Copying:** Ensures accurate copying of text regardless of the keyboard layout.
- **Colorless Copying by Default:** Text is copied without color formatting by default. Hold Shift while clicking Copy to retain colors.
- **SAMP 0.3.7-R3 Support:** Fully compatible with the latest version of SAMP.

**TODO List:**
- **Restore Chat Positioning:** Implement functionality to allow users to move the chat window and its elements.

**Installation:**
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/moreveal/chatpp_rework/releases).
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the Game folder (`Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\`).

**Usage:**
- Launch the game and join a server.
- Experience enhanced chat functionality immediately.
